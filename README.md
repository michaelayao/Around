Geo-based social network web application with Go and React JS

•	Designed and implemented a geo-based social network web application with React JS and Go

•	Implemented features for users to create and browse posts and search nearby posts (Ant Design, GeoLocation API and Google Map API)

•	Improved the authentication using token based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT

•	Launched a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google Kubernetes Engine)

•	Used ElasticSearch (deployed to GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)

•	Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model and integrate with the Go service
